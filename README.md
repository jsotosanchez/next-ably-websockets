# NextJs - Web Sockets Lab

## Goals of this project
This is a small project to get comfortable with new (to me) technologies. The main objectives are:
- Real Time Communication with web sockets
- Familiarizing with Chakra UI
- Authentication with Firebase

### Use Channel

Provides access to Ably API and an Ably channel given a channel name and a callback function to handle all incoming messages.

### Channel Providers

Allows users to use different channels, independent of one another.
